# Send Kin Android

The Send Kin module provides a ready-made UI for the Send Kin functionality of the Kin SDK for Android. The UI enables any user to send Kin to any account on the blockchain. The UI contains an address book that allows the user to save public addresses of his/her contacts and to choose any address to send Kin to. In addition, the module includes a listener that allows the developer to monitor events in the module.
For full documentation you can refer to our website [send kin docs](https://docs.kin.org/android/modules/sendkin).
